Basic Gameplay Functionality
TODO: maintain turns and check for turn during story message
TODO: vote undo story update
TODO: vote kick user
TODO: prevent spam by continuous long strings (but still allow for
potentially made-up words/ other languages/ proper nouns).


Basic Gameplay Aesthetics
TODO: assign users colors
TODO: keep track of who made what contribution in the story (eg, by color)


Login/Joining
TODO: list of rooms on room selection page (after login page)
TODO: option for private room
TODO: unique users/passwords


Security
TODO: onconnection assign user a password (eg some hash); on join room
assign user a pasword. Check these two before executing any user-initiated
server-side action. (currently it only checks for name of user and room to
validate identity.)

Optimization
TODO: add client-side validation and error messages (server should still
validate but not return error messages for user)
TODO: make sure server is sending minimal required information; make it
user-friendly on client side.
TODO: separate style sheets and scripts from jade html

TODO: style sheets

TODO: vote undo
TODO: vote kick user

TODO: list of rooms on room selection page (after login page)
